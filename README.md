# 📈 Inflation Prediction using Machine Learning

This project involves building a machine learning model to predict inflation values using various economic indicators. The data is loaded from a curated Excel dataset and preprocessed using encoding techniques. A Random Forest Regressor is used for prediction.

## ⚙️ Requirements

The following Python libraries are used:

- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- scikit-learn

Install dependencies via:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
```

## 🔍 Project Workflow

1. Load and inspect the dataset
2. Preprocess data using label encoding
3. Split into training and test sets
4. Train a Random Forest Regressor
5. Evaluate using Mean Absolute Error and R² Score
6. Visualize results and analyze model performance

## 📊 Model Evaluation

- Evaluation metrics include:
  - Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
  - R² Score
- Visualizations help understand feature importance and prediction accuracy.
